### Learnings from this assignment
With this assignment, I got better at understanding REST APIs, which are like a way for different programs to talk to each other over the internet. I also got better at writing down how the software works and testing it thoroughly using a tool called pytest.

When I worked on fixing problems with the software, it felt like solving real-life puzzles. I go to know about SQLAlchemy which is a Python library that helps to connect to databases.

This assignment helped me get better at the technical side of things and understand more about how APIs and software testing work in the real world. These skills are really important for my career growth and will help me in my future projects.
